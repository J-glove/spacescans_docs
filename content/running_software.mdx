# Running the Software
To run the SPACESCANS software, clone the repo:
    - [website](https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/SPACESCANS-web-app-REAL)
    - [library/cli](https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/SPACESCANS)

> Note: While the library repo is public, the website repo is not. If you cannot access the repo, then you will have to get access from someone who can grant it.


## Website
For the website, you will need Docker installed. Follow the instructions in the README for building the images and running the website.

## Library/Command Line Interface
The library and command line interface are housed in a single repo. The `spacescans/` subdirectory contains the library code, while any code 
specifically for the command line interface should be kept outside of this subdirectory.
