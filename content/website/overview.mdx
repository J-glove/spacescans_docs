# Overview
The main purpose of the website is to provide linkage in a graphical user interface which is convenient to use and runs 
on our hardware instead of the researcher's hardware. In addition to performing linkage, the website also serves as a hub
for all information regarding the project as a whole. This includes the data catalog, which gives information about every
variable available in our database, has download and installation instructions for the command line interface and library, and
provides documentation for the whole process.

The website is currently using an older version of the linkage library to be able to perform linkage. Some work needs to be done to update
the linkage package for the website.

### Performing Linkage
Linkage on the website is locked behind an account system. Users can only perform linkage by first creating an account.
Once logged in, users are given a dashboard which provides an overview of all linkage runs tied to the account. These runs
are called `tasks` in the UI. For each task, the dashboard gives a status, such as `RUNNING`, and provides the user with
various actions, such as pausing or cancelling a task. If the task is currently running, a progess bar indicates how far along
the task is in the linkage process.

### Task Creation
From the dashboard, users can navigate to the `Create a Task` page which allows users to upload deidentified patient data
and input the necessary information for performing linkage. This is also where the desired variables to link against are chosen.

### Results 
From the dashboard, users can navigate to a results overview page which shows all tasks which have completed and are ready for download.
