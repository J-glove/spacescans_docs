# Overview
This documentation hub gives an in depth breakdown of the SPACESCANS Project, its various components, and the motivation for design.
This documentation is provided to aid in development and generally not intended to be user-facing.

## Introduction
The SPACESCANS project is an r24 funded software project which aims to provide convenient tools for carrying out the task of linking historical patient data to exernal variables, called exposomes.
The project consists of three primary modules for allowing users to link patient data to exposomes: a Python library, a website, and a command line tool.

### Python library
At the core of the entire project is the Python library. The motivation is to provide users with an easy to install package that would allow for
full customization of the tooling to implement into their own data pipelines. The end goal is for this library to be `pip` installable and
the design of the website and command line interface components hinges on importing this library like a `pip` package. This should make
future version controll easier as updates to the linkage library would just require an update through `pip` rather than importing the updated
package manually. The library contains the core functionality for linkage, preprocessing, address cleaning, and validation. 
The intention is for the library to contain all the functionality needed to perform linkage, while the website and command line interface
provide wrapper code to actually run linkage smoothly and conveniently.

### Website
The website provides an easy to use graphical user interface for non-technical users and allows users to easily link against the datasets we have available.
This method additionally allows users to leverage our computing power, which is helpful for smaller teams who may not have access to pwoerful servers. 
The wesbite additionally provides a data catalog, which is being developed in conjunction with Dr. Cui Tao and her team at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville.

### Command Line Interface
The command line interface allows for users to run linkage locally via the command line. This method allows for complete privacy and 
allows users to run linkage against their own exposome data conveniently. The command line should not ship with the exposome database.
