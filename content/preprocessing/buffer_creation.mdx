## Buffer Creation
Different exposomes use varying catographic boundary mappings. To align with these sources, we create buffer files that map 9-digit ZIP codes (used by the address history) to the geographic standards of the exposome data.

### Input Files
- __9-digit Zip-code Latitude/Longitude Data__:

    Derived from the OneFlorida+ database. This dataset provides 9-digit zip-code data with integrated longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates and is updated regularly.
    
    - __Example Columns__:

        - AREAKEY
        - CT
        - X (longitude)
        - Y (latitude)

- __Shape Files__:

    Include County, ZCTA, Census Tract, and Block Group shape files downloaded from the US Census site (currently TIGER2010).

### Output File Specifications
The output file from buffer generation is a .csv, with UPPERCASE column names and a prefix for zip-code columns (ZIP_5 or ZIP_9)

### Command Line Interface
TBD
