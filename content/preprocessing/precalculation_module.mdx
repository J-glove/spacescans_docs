## Precalculation Module 
The precalculation module uses the pre-generated buffer files to compute area-weighted averages for each exposome variable at the ZIP code level. This conversion is necessary because the raw exposome data is typically reported in other geographic formats (e.g., FIPS codes).

### Input Format
- __Formatted Exposome Data__:

    Processed data with standardized headers and geographic identifiers.

- __Buffer File__:

    Generated in the previous step, mapping the raw geographic units to zip-code

### Output File Specifications
The output is a .csv file with all column names in UPPERCASE, with a standardized geoidentifier and temporal naming convention regardless of datasource. (e.g. ZIP_9, YEAR, QUARTER)


### Command Line Interface
TBD

### Guidelines for Implementing Formatters
- __Consistency__:

    Ensure that all output files adhere strictly to the standards. Each file must have properly capitalized headers that accurately reflect the content.

- __Reference Documentation__:

    The output should conform to the Exposome SQLite Database Specification.

- __Verification__:

    Validate that all column headers are correct, and that the data aligns with the expected formats (e.g. geo-identifier and time units).
