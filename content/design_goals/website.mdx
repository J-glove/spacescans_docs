# Website 
The website's primary purpose is to provide linkage in a convenient way, however we decided that it makese sense to host other key information about the project
on this website since it needs to exist anyway. This includes a data catalog of all the exposome data that we have available, which is being organized
using an ontology that is in development by Mayo Clinic, documentation about using the command line interfact and the library, and installation instructions for both.

One key issue to consider in future development is with the user uploaded patient dataset. We need to be able to ensure that a user
has not uploaded IRB protected data, or any sort of PHI.
