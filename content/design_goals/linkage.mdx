# Linkage
The design for linkage itself was previously done by translating from expsoome source geoidentifier to ZIP9 at runtime. This
was extremely costly and meant that calculations were being repeated often. For example, if `PAT_1` and `PAT_2` both lived in zipcode 123456789
in the year 2016, then the translation for 123456789 would be done twice for an exposome. Clearly, this calculation does not depend on the patient
data itself, but rather the zipcode. 

A more efficient way to handle this issue at runtime is to calculate these translations once, ahead of time. This means more computation upfront,
but less time spent during linkage. To this end, we decided to implement a `preprocessing pipeline` which takes raw exposomes and translates them to
9-digit zipcode, which is then stored in a database that can be queried during linkage.

This works well and cuts down the linkage time from days or weeks to minutes. The only caveat to this implementation is that it is not easy to make
this versatile. With the desire for users to "bring their own data", as mentioned in the R24, there still needs to be an option to do this translation at
runtime. This has yet to be implemented. 

We additionally want to be able to generalize the preprocessing pipeline so that users can run it on their own data, not just for the exposome
data specific to us.
