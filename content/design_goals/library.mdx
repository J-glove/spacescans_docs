# Library
The library functions as the core of the project. Within the library is all of the necessary code to perform linkage,
clean patient datasets, and run preprocessing tasks. The library is structured to operate as a `pip` installable library
to allow for easy portability. The initial work for setting the library up to be a `pip` package has been done by Chengrong.
Because of this structure, development with the library should be treated as if developing with a `pip` package. This means
that thought should go into how the scripts are structured, and how everything is named. For example, to import the linkage function,
we would want the syntax to be:
    ```
    from spacescans.linkage import link
    ```


The current naming and layout could perhaps be streamlined in the future. Other than this, additions to the library should
contain only code which is essential to the linkage and preprocessing process. 

The library only provides the functionality for the linkage and preprocessing processes. It cannot run these processes by itself.
Any code written for the purposes of running preprocessing or linkage should **NOT** be added to the library.
