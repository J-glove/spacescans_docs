# Running Linkage from the Command Line

### Installation

1. Clone the repo to your local directory
2. In the root of the repo, create a `projects` folder and an `output` folder

        ```
        mkdir projects
        mkdir output
        ```

### Configuring
The command line needs to be updated to point to the available database. In your favorite code editor, open `run_spacescans.py`.
Navigate to line 30 and update the `DB_URL` to the absolute path of the db file.  
### Running the Command Line
The command line interface uses projects to store information about a specific run of linkage. In order to get started running linkage, a user must create a project. The project can then be used to run linkage. 

#### 1. create_project
Allows the user to create a new project. In addition to specifying a name, you can add all necessary metadata when calling the command, otherwise the program will prompt you to enter any metadata that was missed

*Accepted Flags*
- `-p`: The name of the project
- `-s`: Start date of the study period in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `-e`: End date of the study period in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `-g`: The geoidentifier used in the patient dataset (9-digit zipcode, 5-digit zipcode, etc)
- `-f`: The location of your patient dataset
- `-h`: Help.

*Syntax*

    ```
    $ python3 run_spacescans.py create_project [-h] [-p PROJECT_NAME] [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE] [-g GEOID] [-f FILEPATH]
    ```
#### 2. link
Allows the user to run linkage using a specified project name

*Accepted Flags*
- `-p`: The name of the project
- `-h`: Help.

*Syntax*

    ```
    $ python3 run_spacescans.py link [-h] [-p PROJECT_NAME]
    ```

#### 3. show
Queries the database file and outputs the available data sources and variables.

*Syntax*

    ```
    $ python3 run_spacescans.py show
    ```
